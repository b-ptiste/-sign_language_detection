### Description

We made this project for a course we took during an Erasmus exchange during the summer semester in 2022.

The archive is composed of :

-   a Readme document : Readme.md

-   a project report : IA_project_report_CALLARD_HARIVEL.pdf

-   a Python script which allows to visualize and test our model in real time : script.py

-   two notebooks for the two different model we implements :

    -   the CNN model : CNN_model.ipynb

    -   the SVM model : SVM_model.ipynb

-   the CNN model store in the file : my_model_20_new.h5, my_model_60_new.h5, my_model_without_aug.h5
